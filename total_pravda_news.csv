At the same time, she added, Ukraine granted UN experts unhindered confidential access to the official places of internment of Russian prisoners of war, while Russia did not grant such access.We have launched English Twitter!

We are deeply concerned about the summary execution of up to 25 Russian POWs and persons hors de combat [out of action due to injury or damage ‚Äì ed.] by Ukrainian armed forces which we have documented. This was often perpetrated immediately upon capture on the battlefield. While we are aware of ongoing investigations by Ukrainian authorities into five cases involving 22 victims, we are not aware of any prosecutions of the perpetrators.""Details: According to Bogner, nearly half of the 229 Russian prisoners of war interviewed by mission members claimed torture or ill-treatment. Most of such cases occurred at the first stages of detention and interrogation, she clarified.Quote: ""In relation to the treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war, we are also deeply concerned by the summary execution of 15 Ukrainian prisoners of war shortly after being captured by Russian armed forces. The Wagner Group military and security contractors perpetrated 11 of these executions.""Details: According to the UN, the majority of Ukrainian prisoners of war who were captured during the battle were tortured and ill-treated before internment.""Members of Russian armed forces and the Russian Security Service tortured and ill-treated them to extract military information, to intimidate or humiliate them, or as a form of retribution. Forms of torture included beating, electrocution, or in several cases, being shot or stabbed in the legs. Mock executions were also common,"" Bogner said.According to her, ""Conditions for many Ukrainian prisoners of war were shocking,"" and access to medical care was often insufficient or non-existent.The report states that five Ukrainian prisoners of war died during internment due to lack of medical care.""The number of documented cases of torture and ill-treatment during internment in penitentiary facilities is shocking ‚Äì more than 84 per cent endured such mistreatment. Penitentiary staff subjected prisoners of war to so-called ‚Äòwelcome beatings‚Äô upon their arrival, beat and electrocuted them regularly during inspections in cells or while walking them around the facilities,"" said Bogner.She added that former Ukrainian prisoners of war reported fearing the weekly visits to the showers, which inevitably ended in beatings and humiliation, often with sexual overtones.""When violations do occur, prompt action must be taken, first within the ranks of the army itself, and also through full and effective investigations and prosecutions of those responsible for the acts committed and those in command,"" said the head of the UN mission.Previously: As of 19 March, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights confirmed the death of 8,317 and the wounding of 13,892 civilians in Ukraine as a result of Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion. The organisation stresses that the real death toll is much higher because there are delays in receiving information from some places where fighting is ongoing, and many reports still need to be confirmed.On 16 March in Geneva, experts of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry presented a report on the collected evidence of violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law during the last year of the full-scale armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.As the commissioners emphasized, many of Russia‚Äôs acts ‚Äì deliberate killings, attacks on civilians, illegal imprisonment, torture, rape, forced transfer and deportation of children ‚Äì amounted to war crimes.When journalists asked the head of the commission, Erik M√∏se, whether the given facts could be considered genocide, he replied that he had not found such evidence yet.

The first incident occurred in May 2022, when during a telephone conversation with Tamara Fediuk, Metropolitan Pavlo made remarks condoning the Russian Federation‚Äôs aggression. He also recorded a video message to members of the UOC-MP in which he disparaged the OCU and urged them ""to be reasonable and not to follow the instructions of the 'mad tormentors'.""The prosecutors stressed that there was a risk of the suspect escaping, putting pressure on witnesses, and destroying or distorting evidence.The defence lawyers objected to the application and requested a more lenient restrictive measure ‚Äì personal recognisance.We have launched English Twitter!

I have done nothing to be accused of anything. I have always been against aggression. I am now in Ukraine. This is my land,"" Metropolitan Pavlo said.He also asked to be provided with a copy of the recordings referred to by the investigation and for Romanchuk and Klos, the complainants, who he said were representatives of the OCU, to be questioned; he said they were prejudiced against him and that he did not know them personally.Metropolitan Pavlo also stated in court that he had been ""threatened with hanging and murder"". When asked if it was indeed his voice on the recordings shared by the Security Service of Ukraine, he said, ""Maybe I was joking and did say something like that.""""I know that this is a political order. I was told to go over to the OCU. The SSU [Security Service of Ukraine] summoned me to see the director of the museum and said that a criminal case had to be opened against me. And that's what they did. I won't look into who [did it], I'm not going to settle scores. I accept it all as the will of God,"" the Metropolitan said.During the court hearing, the issue of Pavlo‚Äôs place of residence arose. He asked that if house arrest is to be imposed as a restrictive measure, he be left in the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, where he has lived for 29 years. However, the prosecutors noted that he is registered at a different address, and the Lavra belongs to the state.The court placed Metropolitan Pavlo under round-the-clock house arrest at his address on Molodizhna Street.According to an Ukrainska Pravda source, Metropolitan Pavlo will remain under house arrest in the village of Voronkiv, Boryspil district, Kyiv Oblast; an ankle tag will be used to monitor his whereabouts.As of 21:50, Pavlo was refusing to put on the tag, claiming to have problems with his legs. A doctor was on his way to the court.

But Russia‚Äôs security services rarely enforced the rules, according to former officials and executives.This changed after the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, when security services began warning against travel to countries such as the US or the UK. After the full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, restrictions were applied much more broadly.For example, executives at one major state industrial company are banned from travelling further than two hours‚Äô drive from Moscow without official permission.In other cases, officers from Russia‚Äôs Federal Security Service (FSB) have asked former officials who previously had access to state secrets to surrender their passports, and even some officials who never had such access.Alexandra Prokopenko, a former Russian central bank official, said passport restrictions had now expanded beyond individuals with security clearance.We have launched English Twitter!

What is it? Why is it secret and who decides that? Nobody knows.""More details: As the FT noted, these steps have come at the same time as discontent with the sputtering war effort and its impact on their lifestyles grows among the elite. Once able to spend their riches on mansions, yachts and Western boarding schools for their children, Russian officials and oligarchs are now chafing at being confined to countries not deemed ""unfriendly"". Several members of the elite spoke to the FT about that.Dmitry Peskov, Putin‚Äôs spokesperson, confirmed Russia had tightened the restrictions on foreign travel for some who work in ""sensitive"" areas. He said this in an interview with the Financial Times.Quote: ""There are stricter rules for this.

However, there are also fundamental shortcomings in the work of the special services, which have significantly contributed to the failure of Russia‚Äôs plans to invade Ukraine.""Details: The analysts believe one of these shortcomings is the desire to please the president of the aggressor country, Vladimir Putin, in every possible way.The Russian military considered the internal destabilisation and disorganisation of Ukraine as one of the main mechanisms of their military operation; this was supposed to disable the system of management and military command and control, undermine public confidence in state institutions, reduce the country's stability and minimise assistance to Ukraine from international partners.In these circumstances, Moscow did not anticipate serious resistance, as evidenced by failures in logistics at the first stage of the operation, the report says.The small group of planners expected to repeat the success of the 2014 Crimean operation, which also made no sense from a military point of view and was planned based on the absence of military resistance from Ukraine.We have launched English Twitter! Follow us! According to the RUSI, the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) was deeply involved in planning the invasion, and was ordered to prepare plans for the occupation of Ukraine in July 2021. This required the training of numerous FSB agents, so in autumn 2021, Russian agents in Ukraine began to go on brief holidays to resorts in T√ºrkiye, Cyprus and Egypt, where they met with their handlers.The report's authors pay considerable attention to the methods used by the Russian secret services, noting that they prefer to minimise the running of agents from Russia, recruiting agents in place who manage their networks instead.In the case of Ukraine, the report says this role was played by several high-ranking officials and politicians who had had ties to Russian intelligence agencies for decades.The authors also note the importance of the Russian Orthodox Church as the one body of ideologically committed agents of Russian influence. Since relations between the state and religious institutions are sensitive, even after the invasion, the Ukrainian authorities could not immediately constrain the activities of these parts of the Russian support apparatus.Russian agents were also supposed to provoke full-scale protests in Ukraine.The authors of the report note that senior Russian intelligence officials recommended delaying the invasion until summer 2022; in their opinion, the conditions for a quick victory in early 2022 had not yet developed at the time. However, Moscow decided to proceed, because the Kremlin believed they understood Ukrainian politics.The report's authors consider the hasty and underprepared invasion as evidence that Russian agents had exaggerated the extent of their influence. The secret services had been ordered to facilitate the occupation within the established time frame, not to assess its viability.The authors consider this institutional culture of following orders to be one of the reasons for the failure of the original plans for the invasion of Ukraine.Journalists fight on their own frontline.

According to officials and court records, his real name is Sergey Cherkasov, and he had spent nearly a decade building the fictitious Ferreira persona. He was exposed last year.The charges brought before the court resulted from years of work by the FBI. Among other things, the investigators got access to the materials collected by the Brazilian authorities and also received permission to meet with Cherkasov-Ferreira, who is currently in custody in S√£o Paulo.In 2018, ""Ferreira"" was admitted to Johns Hopkins University to study international relations.According to the FBI, in recent years, thanks to his contacts in Washington, Cherkasov became a useful person for Russian intelligence and passed his supervisors in the GRU information that could be of interest to them ‚Äì among other things, how top officials in the Biden administration reacted to Russia's build-up of troops near the borders of Ukraine before the full-scale war.After he graduated, ""Ferreira"" came close to achieving a more consequential penetration, when he was offered a position at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. He was due to start a six-month internship there last year ‚Äî just as the court began investigating Russian war crimes in Ukraine.¬†We have launched English Twitter! Follow us! However, the plans did not come true. Dutch authorities turned him away acting on information relayed by the FBI. Officials in the Netherlands put him on a plane back to Brazil, where he was arrested upon landing and is now serving a 15-year prison sentence for document fraud related to his fake identity.Authorities have mined Cherkasov's computer and other devices and found a trove of evidence, according to court records and security officials, including emails to his Russian handlers, details about ""dead drops"" where messages could be left, records of illicit money transfers, and an error-strewn personal history that he appears to have composed while trying to memorise details of his fictitious life. Among other things, he prepared an explanation for his unusual appearance and accent by claiming that his ancestors were German, and he himself spent a lot of time abroad.The GRU appears to have exploited vulnerabilities in Brazil's immigration and record-keeping system, while also relying on inside help. A notary who signed off on many of Cherkasov‚Äôs fraudulent submissions received expensive gifts from him.Russia has denied that Cherkasov is a spy and requested his extradition from Brazil by presenting what U.S. officials regard as yet another fictional identity, claiming that he is neither a student nor a secret agent but a wanted heroin trafficker who fled Russia to avoid prison.Cherkasov's accounts of his life have also shifted dramatically. After initially insisting that he was Ferreira and that Dutch authorities were mistaken, he admitted his Russian identity in hopes that doing so would help him secure a reduced sentence.In the US, Cherkasov is accused of agent activity for the benefit of a foreign state, as well as fraud related to bank accounts and visas.It is not clear whether the United States will also seek Cherkasov's extradition, but U.S. officials said one of the considerations behind the indictment was that it might help preempt Russia's attempt to secure the return of its spy.This is at least the second case of exposure of Russian agents who worked under the guise of Brazilian citizens. For example, an employee of the GRU was detained in Norway last autumn; he pretended to be a Brazilian professor and got a job at the Arctic University of Troms√∏.Journalists fight on their own frontline.

Over the past 24 hours, 35 combat engagements took place on the entire Bakhmut front, particularly in and around the area of [the settlements of] Bakhmut, Bohdanivka and Predtechyno, and 29 in the area of the town itself and its outskirts.

However, he said the Russian military is not achieving its goals in Ukraine‚Äôs east.Quote: ""They have several lines of attack. You remember that there was an announcement of a major offensive, and I think these attacking elements are probably attempts.However, their attempts to attack and break through our defences were countered by the fact that our leadership saw their intentions, predicted them, and therefore built a competently echeloned defence. Even at the stage of deploying troops, Ukrainian missile and artillery strikes, as well as aircraft attacked them [Russians]. Or even destroyed them directly in close combat.Therefore, the enemy has not achieved any significant gains. First of all, they were unable to break through our defences, surround our troops, and reach our rear, and they kept suffering huge losses.Our heroic soldiers, who engage [the Russian army] every day in difficult conditions, grind down its capabilities, break its combat procedures and break its moral and psychological state.""Journalists fight on their own frontline.

Zubariev filmed a video and posted it on his Telegram channel, PREDATOR.The footage shows the 21-year-old soldier destroying a Russian BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) and killing several invaders in 30 minutes of combat. Predator uses various weapons [an RPG-7 grenade launcher, machine gun and assault rifle] and throws grenades at the Russian troops from his foxhole.We have launched English Twitter! Follow us! Predator said the Russian group consisted of 11 soldiers and reinforcements could have joined them, as the Russian positions were 70 metres away.A Ukrainian mortar crew and an IFV arrived to assist the Ukrainian defenders. The Ukrainian forces held their position and forced the Russian troops to retreat.The soldier's military partner sustained a concussion during the combat, but still supported Predator with ammunition throughout the battle.Later, Zubariev described the battle in detail.Quote from Zubariev: ""The day was as ordinary as could be. My partner and I took up our duty, stood guard for an hour and a half, and there was literally half an hour left before we'd be coming off duty and getting some rest, but we heard the sounds of a [moving] BMP-2. Thinking it was somewhere far away, I decided to get the anti-tank weapons ready, and about 10 seconds later, we got a call on the radio warning us that the same BMP-2 was moving in our direction.We didn't really understand what they were saying on the radio as the Russians were using jamming equipment, and when we were told again that vehicles were moving towards us, they were like 5 metres away, and then the events you‚Äôve all seen on the video began.Eventually, we repelled the attack, and those who managed to survive ran away. The rest of them are still lying there.My comrade is fine. He was concussed at the time, but he could still help me; he gave me everything I asked for, listened and followed my orders, for which I am very grateful.""Details: Zubariev says Zaluzhnyi awarded him an M4 assault rifle.

But Russia‚Äôs security services rarely enforced the rules, according to former officials and executives.This changed after the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, when security services began warning against travel to countries such as the US or the UK. After the full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, restrictions were applied much more broadly.For example, executives at one major state industrial company are banned from travelling further than two hours‚Äô drive from Moscow without official permission.In other cases, officers from Russia‚Äôs Federal Security Service (FSB) have asked former officials who previously had access to state secrets to surrender their passports, and even some officials who never had such access.Alexandra Prokopenko, a former Russian central bank official, said passport restrictions had now expanded beyond individuals with security clearance.We have launched English Twitter!

What is it? Why is it secret and who decides that? Nobody knows.""More details: As the FT noted, these steps have come at the same time as discontent with the sputtering war effort and its impact on their lifestyles grows among the elite. Once able to spend their riches on mansions, yachts and Western boarding schools for their children, Russian officials and oligarchs are now chafing at being confined to countries not deemed ""unfriendly"".

Moreover, the day before, information appeared in Russian media space that Sergei Shoigu, Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation, was inspecting the plant where a production line for the creation of such bombs has been launched.It indicates the date ‚Äì 2023, and that Russians plan to manufacture one-and-a-half-ton bombs. According to Ihnat, obviously, they will also be equipped with wings and GPS navigation.According to representatives of the Air Force, modern fighterjets such as the F-16 can become a powerful means of countermeasures [keeping Russian aircraft at a distance that does not allow the use of such aerial bombs ‚Äì ed].Lieutenant General Oleschuk gives other arguments in favour of these aircraft.Quote:We have launched English Twitter! Follow us! ""The most effective countermeasure against the use of guided aerial bombsIncreasingly, Russia is using guided aerial bombs weighing 500 kg along the entire front line. There are signs of preparation for the mass use of 1,500 kg KABs [Russian precision guided weapon ‚Äì ed.]!The aircraft of the Russians do not enter the zone of damage of our air defence, striking remotely at the front line and near-frontline cities. Civilians in the northern, southern, and eastern oblasts are suffering.The F-16 is armed with air-to-air missiles with a range of up to 180 km. This will make it possible to drive enemy aircraft away from our borders and the line of combat, which will minimise the likelihood of using guided aerial bombs and other air-based weapons.The best protection of rear areasOn average, our [Ukraine's] air defence destroys about 75% of cruisemissiles and attack drones. But 25% still reach their targets!Civilians die, and infrastructure is destroyed. F-16s can effectively destroy these air threats even at the borders, preventing missiles and drones from reaching our cities.The advantage in the air is the reliable cover of the front lineRussian aircraft outnumber Ukrainian by many times, and most importantly, the occupiers have a technological advantage.The Air Force does not have enough forces and assets, both ground and air, to effectively protect airspace, troops on the front lines and civilians in the front-line zone from the daily terror of enemy attack aircraft and helicopters.F-16 will allow gaining air supremacy, significantly weakening the enemy, and saving many lives every day.A powerful strike backThe wide range of modern high-precision weapons of the F-16 will allow for high-precision strikes on Russian troops during counter-offensive actions. It is necessary to stop the offensive actions of the enemy, to gain superiority in the air, and to destroy the means of supply of equipment, ammunition, and manpower of the enemy. F-16 will be able to perform these tasks!Control of the seaThe Black Sea is still under the control of the Russian fleet. F-16s are armed with powerful anti-ship missiles that can easily drive the entire enemy fleet either to ports or to the bottom of the sea. Ukraine needs to ensure freedom of navigation and protection of grain corridors.Pilots are hostages of old technologiesThe available equipment and armament of Soviet aircraft turned all the missions of our pilots into mortally dangerous ones, which caused irreparable losses of the best sons of Ukraine.Only modern technologies will make their work effective and safe. Our pilots are trained and motivated to learn. And they are enough to fight and study at the same time. Our pilots dream of F-16s, they deserve to fly on the best planes!Serviceability, spare partsUkraine uses 40-year-old aircraft. Some planes are twice as old as their pilots! It becomes more and more difficult to maintain their serviceability every day. Own stocks of spare parts are running low, and allies do not have those either.Many issues are closed through the so-called ""cannibalization"", but this cannot last forever. You can't wait until all aircraft stop completely. Thanks to the transfer of aircraft from Slovakia and Poland, it will be possible to restore the MiG-29 aircraft fleet of several air brigades to a certain extent and strengthen the capabilities of fighter aircraft to perform current combat missions. However, to achieve superiority in the air, to win, we need modern aircraft!Stockpiles of ammunitionStocks of even outdated and ineffective Soviet ammunition for the existing aircraft fleet are steadily decreasing. Even with a sufficient number of serviceable planes and trained pilots, at a certain point, our Air Forces will be left without weapons. Switching to the F-16 or another Western platform with a wide range of modern weapons is the only way out!""Journalists fight on their own frontline.

However, there are also fundamental shortcomings in the work of the special services, which have significantly contributed to the failure of Russia‚Äôs plans to invade Ukraine.""Details: The analysts believe one of these shortcomings is the desire to please the president of the aggressor country, Vladimir Putin, in every possible way.The Russian military considered the internal destabilisation and disorganisation of Ukraine as one of the main mechanisms of their military operation; this was supposed to disable the system of management and military command and control, undermine public confidence in state institutions, reduce the country's stability and minimise assistance to Ukraine from international partners.In these circumstances, Moscow did not anticipate serious resistance, as evidenced by failures in logistics at the first stage of the operation, the report says.The small group of planners expected to repeat the success of the 2014 Crimean operation, which also made no sense from a military point of view and was planned based on the absence of military resistance from Ukraine.We have launched English Twitter! Follow us! According to the RUSI, the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) was deeply involved in planning the invasion, and was ordered to prepare plans for the occupation of Ukraine in July 2021. This required the training of numerous FSB agents, so in autumn 2021, Russian agents in Ukraine began to go on brief holidays to resorts in T√ºrkiye, Cyprus and Egypt, where they met with their handlers.The report's authors pay considerable attention to the methods used by the Russian secret services, noting that they prefer to minimise the running of agents from Russia, recruiting agents in place who manage their networks instead.In the case of Ukraine, the report says this role was played by several high-ranking officials and politicians who had had ties to Russian intelligence agencies for decades.The authors also note the importance of the Russian Orthodox Church as the one body of ideologically committed agents of Russian influence. Since relations between the state and religious institutions are sensitive, even after the invasion, the Ukrainian authorities could not immediately constrain the activities of these parts of the Russian support apparatus.Russian agents were also supposed to provoke full-scale protests in Ukraine.The authors of the report note that senior Russian intelligence officials recommended delaying the invasion until summer 2022; in their opinion, the conditions for a quick victory in early 2022 had not yet developed at the time. However, Moscow decided to proceed, because the Kremlin believed they understood Ukrainian politics.The report's authors consider the hasty and underprepared invasion as evidence that Russian agents had exaggerated the extent of their influence. The secret services had been ordered to facilitate the occupation within the established time frame, not to assess its viability.The authors consider this institutional culture of following orders to be one of the reasons for the failure of the original plans for the invasion of Ukraine.Journalists fight on their own frontline.

In the document, Sisi instructs the officials to keep the production and shipment of the rockets secret ""to avoid problems with the West"".The Washington Post obtained the document from a trove of images of classified files posted in February and March on Discord, a chat app popular with gamers. The document has not been previously reported.A US government official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to address sensitive information, said that ""We are not aware of any execution of that plan,"" referring to the rocket export initiative. ""We have not seen that [delivery of missiles from Egypt to the Russian Federation ‚Äì ed.] happen,"" the official added.The Washington Post emphasised that ""providing arms to Russia for its war in Ukraine would represent a potentially explosive gambit for Egypt, a nation that, despite deepening ties with Moscow, remains deeply invested in its partnership with the United States, which for decades has provided the country more than $1 billion a year in security aid"".We have launched English Twitter! Follow us! The document does not explicitly state why Russia is interested in acquiring the rockets, but its military has been expending huge amounts of ammunition in the war, and the US government has claimed that North Korea is covertly supplying Russia with artillery rounds and that China is considering doing the same.Senator Chris Murphy, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations and Appropriations committees, said that ""Egypt is one of our oldest allies in the Middle East,"" so¬† ""if it's true that Sisi is covertly building rockets for Russia that could be used in Ukraine, we need to have a serious reckoning about the state of our relationship"".Sarah Margon, director of US foreign policy at the Open Society Foundations and the Biden administration‚Äôs onetime nominee for the State Department's top human rights post, said that ""an intentional sale and delivery of rockets to the Russian government, which has committed such explicit war and other atrocity crimes, is just beyond the pale, especially for an ostensibly close U.S. ally"".As The Washington Post noted that the document describes Sisi issuing instructions on 1 February for keeping the supply of rockets secret in order ""to avoid problems with ‚Äòthe West,"" telling a person mentioned only as Salah al-Din that factory workers should be told the projectiles are intended for the Egyptian army.¬†Salah al-Din, as The Washington Post supposed, is probably Mohamed Salah al-Din, the minister of state for military production.¬†The gunpowder offered to Russia, which is mentioned in the document, would come from Factory 18, the name of a chemical manufacturing plant that has existed for several decades, the newspaper writes.The document quotes Salah al-Din as saying he would ""order his people to work shift work if necessary because it was the least Egypt could do to repay Russia for unspecified help earlier"".

Follow us! Therefore, Russia's decentralised mobilisation efforts are aimed at redistributing the resource burden between law enforcement agencies and units of the state system.In this regard, the Kremlin is reportedly billing the Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom for its volunteer recruitment efforts in occupied Donetsk Oblast, offering volunteers 400,000 roubles (approximately $4,900) of salary per month.The institute notes that the resources of various Russian groups are finite. And the Kremlin's efforts to replenish them will exhaust themselves without redistribution reform.Experts add that the decision of the Russian authorities ""to continue relying on financial incentivizing voluntary recruits with both one-time payments and accrued lifetime benefits will create large long-term structural costs and will not be sustainable indefinitely.""Key takeaways from ISW for 13 April:A senior Ukrainian official warned that Russia can reconstitute itself as a serious threat to Ukraine in the long run despite facing severe force generation problems at this time.Ukrainian assessments confirm ISW‚Äôs longstanding assessment that Russia cannot conduct multiple offensive operations simultaneously at this time.Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly personally approved the arrest of Wall Street Journal correspondent Evan Gershkovich.The Russian Federal State Security Service (FSB) on April 13 identified the individuals allegedly responsible for assassinating milblogger Maxim Fomin (alias Vladlen Tatarsky).Russian forces continued limited ground attacks along the Svatove-Kreminna line.Russian forces continued to make gains in Bakhmut, and continued ground attacks along the Avdiivka-Donetsk City line.Russian forces continue to reinforce and strengthen their positions in southern Ukraine in preparation for a potential Ukrainian counteroffensive.Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin and his supporters continue to feud with St. Petersburg authorities and advertising companies allegedly obstructing Wagner Group recruitment efforts.Wagner Group are reportedly training Ukrainian children to use weapons as part of the Russian Young Army Cadets National Movement (Yunarmiya) in occupied Ukraine.Journalists fight on their own frontline.

The area is highly likely the responsibility of Russia‚Äôs Southern Grouping of Forces (SGF).The UK MoD states Russia has now completed three layers of defensive zones across approximately 120 km of this sector.These consist of a front line of forward combat positions, and then two zones of nearly continuous, more elaborate defences. Each zone is approximately 10-20 km behind the one in front.Quote: ""Russia has probably put significant effort into these defensive works because it is convinced Ukraine is considering an assault towards the city of Melitopol.

The first incident occurred in May 2022, when during a telephone conversation with Tamara Fediuk, Metropolitan Pavlo made remarks condoning the Russian Federation‚Äôs aggression. He also recorded a video message to members of the UOC-MP in which he disparaged the OCU and urged them ""to be reasonable and not to follow the instructions of the 'mad tormentors'.""The prosecutors stressed that there was a risk of the suspect escaping, putting pressure on witnesses, and destroying or distorting evidence.The defence lawyers objected to the application and requested a more lenient restrictive measure ‚Äì personal recognisance.We have launched English Twitter! Follow us! ""There is a war going on between religious organisations in our society. The church is separate from the state, and it should not interfere,"" said the suspect's lawyer, Mykyta Chekman, who believes that both the notice of suspicion and the risks outlined by the prosecutors are unfounded.Chekman noted that representatives of the OCU, who oppose the UOC-MP, had been questioned as part of the criminal case.Metropolitan Pavlo said that the suspicion was ""political"" and that he had ""always been against aggression"".""I would like Russia to leave us alone. I have done nothing to be accused of anything. I have always been against aggression. I am now in Ukraine. This is my land,"" Metropolitan Pavlo said.He also asked to be provided with a copy of the recordings referred to by the investigation and for Romanchuk and Klos, the complainants, who he said were representatives of the OCU, to be questioned; he said they were prejudiced against him and that he did not know them personally.Metropolitan Pavlo also stated in court that he had been ""threatened with hanging and murder"". When asked if it was indeed his voice on the recordings shared by the Security Service of Ukraine, he said, ""Maybe I was joking and did say something like that.""""I know that this is a political order. I was told to go over to the OCU. The SSU [Security Service of Ukraine] summoned me to see the director of the museum and said that a criminal case had to be opened against me. And that's what they did. I won't look into who [did it], I'm not going to settle scores. I accept it all as the will of God,"" the Metropolitan said.During the court hearing, the issue of Pavlo‚Äôs place of residence arose. He asked that if house arrest is to be imposed as a restrictive measure, he be left in the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, where he has lived for 29 years. However, the prosecutors noted that he is registered at a different address, and the Lavra belongs to the state.The court placed Metropolitan Pavlo under round-the-clock house arrest at his address on Molodizhna Street.According to an Ukrainska Pravda source, Metropolitan Pavlo will remain under house arrest in the village of Voronkiv, Boryspil district, Kyiv Oblast; an ankle tag will be used to monitor his whereabouts.As of 21:50, Pavlo was refusing to put on the tag, claiming to have problems with his legs. A doctor was on his way to the court. Later, the bracelet was put on him after all.Background:¬†On 1 April, Pavlo Lebid was served with a notice of suspicion of ""infringing the equal rights of citizens based on their religious beliefs"", and ""glorifying participants in the Russian Federation‚Äôs armed aggression against Ukraine"".The Security Service of Ukraine also published recordings of Pavlo's phone conversations and sermons.Pavlo Lebid said in the courtroom that he was ""against aggression"" but made no mention of Russia as a perpetrator.The court hearing involving Metropolitan Pavlo Lebid had been postponed until Monday, as Pavlo said that he was not feeling well ""due to his blood sugar level"".

According to officials and court records, his real name is Sergey Cherkasov, and he had spent nearly a decade building the fictitious Ferreira persona. He was exposed last year.The charges brought before the court resulted from years of work by the FBI. Among other things, the investigators got access to the materials collected by the Brazilian authorities and also received permission to meet with Cherkasov-Ferreira, who is currently in custody in S√£o Paulo.In 2018, ""Ferreira"" was admitted to Johns Hopkins University to study international relations.According to the FBI, in recent years, thanks to his contacts in Washington, Cherkasov became a useful person for Russian intelligence and passed his supervisors in the GRU information that could be of interest to them ‚Äì among other things, how top officials in the Biden administration reacted to Russia's build-up of troops near the borders of Ukraine before the full-scale war.After he graduated, ""Ferreira"" came close to achieving a more consequential penetration, when he was offered a position at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. He was due to start a six-month internship there last year ‚Äî just as the court began investigating Russian war crimes in Ukraine.¬†We have launched English Twitter! Follow us! However, the plans did not come true. Dutch authorities turned him away acting on information relayed by the FBI. Officials in the Netherlands put him on a plane back to Brazil, where he was arrested upon landing and is now serving a 15-year prison sentence for document fraud related to his fake identity.Authorities have mined Cherkasov's computer and other devices and found a trove of evidence, according to court records and security officials, including emails to his Russian handlers, details about ""dead drops"" where messages could be left, records of illicit money transfers, and an error-strewn personal history that he appears to have composed while trying to memorise details of his fictitious life. Among other things, he prepared an explanation for his unusual appearance and accent by claiming that his ancestors were German, and he himself spent a lot of time abroad.The GRU appears to have exploited vulnerabilities in Brazil's immigration and record-keeping system, while also relying on inside help. A notary who signed off on many of Cherkasov‚Äôs fraudulent submissions received expensive gifts from him.Russia has denied that Cherkasov is a spy and requested his extradition from Brazil by presenting what U.S. officials regard as yet another fictional identity, claiming that he is neither a student nor a secret agent but a wanted heroin trafficker who fled Russia to avoid prison.Cherkasov's accounts of his life have also shifted dramatically. After initially insisting that he was Ferreira and that Dutch authorities were mistaken, he admitted his Russian identity in hopes that doing so would help him secure a reduced sentence.In the US, Cherkasov is accused of agent activity for the benefit of a foreign state, as well as fraud related to bank accounts and visas.It is not clear whether the United States will also seek Cherkasov's extradition, but U.S. officials said one of the considerations behind the indictment was that it might help preempt Russia's attempt to secure the return of its spy.This is at least the second case of exposure of Russian agents who worked under the guise of Brazilian citizens. For example, an employee of the GRU was detained in Norway last autumn; he pretended to be a Brazilian professor and got a job at the Arctic University of Troms√∏.Journalists fight on their own frontline.

The leadership of the SDF also forbade any strikes on Russian positions in Kurdish areas.""The documents that you are talking about regarding our forces are not real (...) our forces have never been a side in the Russian-Ukrainian war"", said Farhad Shami, an SDF spokesperson, in a comment to The Washington Post.The leaked document, as The Washington Post noted, indicates that T√ºrkiye was aware of the planning, stating that Turkish officials ""sought to avoid potential blowback"" and suggested that Ukraine stage its attacks from Kurdish areas instead of those in the north and northwest held by other rebel groups, with some of them¬† being backed by T√ºrkiye.The Washington Post said that T√ºrkiye opposes the SDF, and also considers its core military element, the People‚Äôs Protection Units or YPG, to be a terrorist group. The SDF is the main partner of the U.S. troops in Syria, where they often share bases on an ongoing mission to stifle the resurgence of the Islamic State.In November, according to the leaked document, Ukrainian military intelligence officers identified potential logistical constraints to their ambitions, including ""issues with intra-Kurdish border controls and establishing a base of operations"".""By 29 December, the officers appear to have found out that Zelenskyy had halted their planning. It is uncertain why Zelenskyy ordered the Chief Intelligence Directorate to cease planning operations, but the document assesses that he may have done so for a variety of reasons: U.S. pressure, Ukraine‚Äôs limited supply of drones or doubts about whether the attacks could succeed.Another factor could have been the success of military intelligence operations in Russia. The document states the Chief Intelligence Directorate has been aggressive in staging sabotage, assassination and destabilising operations in Russian-controlled areas in Ukraine. These areas probably offer advantages in logistics, language and other variables,"" The Washington Post said in its article.Kyiv is unlikely to revive the plans, but if Ukraine did proceed, attacks could ""incur a Russian response targeting US interests in the region if support for an operation is attributed to the United States"", the document emphasised.The document goes into detail about what a campaign of ""notional"" covert Ukrainian attacks might look like, ranking them by the likelihood that they would cause Russia to escalate in response. It weighs attacks on well-defended ""priority"" Russian facilities near Damascus and the Syrian coast, which would be the most dangerous for the attackers but the most costly for Russia, against strikes on ""Russia-affiliated petroleum infrastructure"" in central Syria, which is poorly protected by air defence systems but would only impose ""modest costs"" on Russia, particularly on the Wagner group.The Syrian battlefield ""provides deniability options"" to Ukraine, the document states, because it could attack Russian positions previously struck by Syrian rebels, launch attacks from rebel or even regime-held areas, and attribute attacks to ""front, defunct or active nonstate groups"".The Washington Post added that the documents mention a real but previously undisclosed 27 November incident, in which a Russian SA-22 air defence system based in eastern Syria fired on a U.S. MQ-9 drone. The missile did not hit its target, a U.S. official said.Background:On 7 April, The New York Times, citing sources in the White House, reported a data leak: allegedly classified military documents detailing US and NATO plans to build up the Ukrainian army before a planned counteroffensive had appeared on Twitter and Telegram. More and more documents are appearing in the media.Bellingcat investigators found that the classified data was distributed on 1 and 2 March on a Discord server called WowMao, but the original source may have revealed the documents even earlier.Associated Press journalists talked to users of the Discord platform, and they found out that the secret documents were allegedly distributed by a user with the nickname ""Lucca"", who may be a ""child"".The UK Defence Ministry warned of a ""serious level of inaccuracy"" in allegedly leaked US classified documents relating to the war in Ukraine.Ukraine has already changed some of its military plans because of the leaked classified US documents, and this is delaying its counteroffensive, according to media reports.The US Department of Justice has launched an investigation into the leak of a huge number of US intelligence documents, and the US State Department has stated that the incident with the publication of classified documents will not affect support for Ukraine in the war with Russia.According to media reports, the leak of classified documents has caused a crisis in relations between the United States and its allies.The US Department of Defense said it would have findings on the Internet leak of classified documents within 45 days.Journalists fight on their own frontline.

Most of such cases occurred at the first stages of detention and interrogation, she clarified.Quote: ""In relation to the treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war, we are also deeply concerned by the summary execution of 15 Ukrainian prisoners of war shortly after being captured by Russian armed forces. The Wagner Group military and security contractors perpetrated 11 of these executions.""Details: According to the UN, the majority of Ukrainian prisoners of war who were captured during the battle were tortured and ill-treated before internment.""Members of Russian armed forces and the Russian Security Service tortured and ill-treated them to extract military information, to intimidate or humiliate them, or as a form of retribution. Forms of torture included beating, electrocution, or in several cases, being shot or stabbed in the legs. Mock executions were also common,"" Bogner said.According to her, ""Conditions for many Ukrainian prisoners of war were shocking,"" and access to medical care was often insufficient or non-existent.The report states that five Ukrainian prisoners of war died during internment due to lack of medical care.""The number of documented cases of torture and ill-treatment during internment in penitentiary facilities is shocking ‚Äì more than 84 per cent endured such mistreatment. Penitentiary staff subjected prisoners of war to so-called ‚Äòwelcome beatings‚Äô upon their arrival, beat and electrocuted them regularly during inspections in cells or while walking them around the facilities,"" said Bogner.She added that former Ukrainian prisoners of war reported fearing the weekly visits to the showers, which inevitably ended in beatings and humiliation, often with sexual overtones.""When violations do occur, prompt action must be taken, first within the ranks of the army itself, and also through full and effective investigations and prosecutions of those responsible for the acts committed and those in command,"" said the head of the UN mission.Previously: As of 19 March, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights confirmed the death of 8,317 and the wounding of 13,892 civilians in Ukraine as a result of Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion. The organisation stresses that the real death toll is much higher because there are delays in receiving information from some places where fighting is ongoing, and many reports still need to be confirmed.On 16 March in Geneva, experts of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry presented a report on the collected evidence of violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law during the last year of the full-scale armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.As the commissioners emphasized, many of Russia‚Äôs acts ‚Äì deliberate killings, attacks on civilians, illegal imprisonment, torture, rape, forced transfer and deportation of children ‚Äì amounted to war crimes.When journalists asked the head of the commission, Erik M√∏se, whether the given facts could be considered genocide, he replied that he had not found such evidence yet.

They learn very quickly. As a result, the tactics of conducting military operations are also changing.When they openly invaded Ukraine on 24 February last year, they marched forward in columns, without artillery cover, intelligence, fearing nothing. And they also carried parade uniforms with them, thinking that in three days they would parade through the centre of Kyiv.It cost them dearly. We destroyed these columns, cut their logistics chains. This led to the first, as they called it, ‚Äògesture of goodwill‚Äô, the liberation of Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy oblasts.

And the dream is to reach more than 300 km.""Details: At the same time, according to Reznikov, since World War II, the Kremlin still considers soldiers ""just cannon fodder"" and, as before, uses ""meatgrinder tactics"".""[For example], Bakhmut. Their 'creeping' attack there is going on for the sixth or even seventh month. They use assault waves, attack tactics. There may be 10 or 12 such waves that directly follow each other.

In the south, Russian units have been building defensive positions since they were pushed out of the Kherson region in November. Sophisticated Western tanks, with better survivability and firepower, will be critical in uprooting those positions,"" the newspaper emphasises.Evelyn Farkas, the director of the McCain Institute, said in a comment to the NYT that Ukraine is capable of inflicting losses on the Russian Army that could have far-reaching geopolitical consequences if weapons and trained troops fall into place in time. As she states, ""Ukraine could render Russia a weakened military power in Eastern Europe with little leverage in negotiations to end the war"".She stated that people ""only envision what they see now,"" but much can change with the arrival of new Western weapons and tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers undergoing training in Ukraine and Europe.¬†We have launched English Twitter!

However, the NYT notes that the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is hardly guaranteed, as allies are in no hurry to send weapons, and soldiers have to be content with accelerated courses in assault tactics.Weapons and equipment for breaking through trench lines and crossing minefields are appearing in Ukraine, but it remains unclear whether they are in sufficient quantity, the newspaper writes.At the initial stage, the Ukrainian counteroffensive may well depend on overcoming extensive minefields, military analysts told the NYT. To do this, Ukraine will rely on mine-clearing vehicles that have been in its arsenal since Soviet times, and some of them were captured from the Russians. In addition, Ukraine is now also receiving mine clearance equipment from the West.The NYT notes that demining can be done manually, with soldiers probing the soil and keeping a close eye on tripwires as they walk in front of assault units, or with specialised mine-clearance equipment.Ukraine is expected to strike in the south, where the terrain ranges from sprawling fields to towns and villages, the newspaper stated.""A thrust of about 50 miles [about 80 km - ed.] over the steppe from the current front lines to the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol would split Russian-held territory into two zones, sever supply lines and put Ukrainian artillery within range of Russian bases on the Crimean Peninsula.""At the same time, the newspaper writes, the morale of Ukrainian soldiers, which for most of the war was better than that of the Russians, ""is becoming more of a challenge"".In dozens of recent interviews with the NYT, soldiers in positions near Bakhmut or emerging from street fighting for short breaks expressed horror at the scale of violence and death.One of the most striking examples of military reconstruction, the newspaper notes, is that the Ministry of Internal Affairs is restoring the Azov unit, whose fighters were killed, wounded or captured during the siege of Mariupol and the storming of the Azovstal metallurgical plant last spring, and who were killed in an explosion in a prisoner of war barracks in Olenivka.Recently, Azov recruits spent five weeks learning basic soldiering skills at a base in a pine forest, the NYT reports.""We will train new people, to raise them up to our level,"" said Lieutenant Illia Samoilenko, who was freed from Russian captivity in a prisonerexchange.In order to ensure that only the most motivated soldiers join Azov's assault unit, recruits are given a choice.

Follow us! The leaked documents state that Russia has improved its FAB-500 bomb by giving it wings and a GPS system, allowing it to be dropped from a military aircraft and fly to its intended target without the aircraft ever entering hostile airspace or coming under fire.Such a bomb, dropped by a Su-34 jet, caused an accidental strike on the Russian city of Belgorod, which injured at least three people. Analysts attribute the rise in such incidents to a sharp increase in the number of Russian military flights.Ukrainian military officials are now considering how to provide air cover for troops in an offensive. The country‚Äôs allies have not yet responded to its requests for F-16 jets.Ukrainian soldiers showed the news agency how their ammunition supplies were dwindling at a drone control base in an abandoned house a few miles from the Russian foxholes. A large monitor showed a feed from a Ukrainian drone hovering near the Russian positions, showing several men moving forward. ""If there are less than ten of them, it's a waste of a mortar; we need them to hit their artillery,"" said one of the soldiers.The US $6,000 drone, equipped with night vision cameras, is one of the most expensive used by the unit. As the journalists write, other commercial models cost about US $3,000, many of which were purchased through crowdfunding.However, the Russians are improving their UAV jamming assets, using systems the military believes have recently arrived from China. The most popular drone used by the Ukrainians is a Chinese commercial model. Russia‚Äôs greater success in jamming them has led to speculation on the Ukrainian side that Beijing is helping them do so.According to the media, there are concerns that Russia's advances in jamming drones will result in thousands of Ukraine's UAVs being put out of action, with little prospect of finding replacements. While drones have been recognised as one of Ukraine's most effective and cheapest weapons since the beginning of the conflict, they have become even more important now that ammunition is running low and accurate targeting is critical to preserve supplies.Journalists fight on their own frontline.

Last December, the company was sanctioned by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.CAR researchers found Mado markings on the spark plug caps in the drone's engines, as well as sequences of serial numbers used by Mado.A Mado MD-550 engine, documented in Ukraine last DecemberAccording to CNN, according to Western governments and the UN, Mado plays a crucial role in Iran's drone industry. The same sequence of serial numbers was also noticed by UN investigators looking into drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, allegedly carried out by Iran's Houthi allies in Yemen, as well as missile attacks on Abu Dhabi last year.We have launched English Twitter! Follow us! Taimur Khan, a Gulf analyst at CAR, told CNN that Iran's UAV systems are constantly being improved and modernised and ""have proven to be increasingly accurate in terms of guidance and targeting systems and jamming capabilities.""The design of the engine shows that over the years, Iran has made significant efforts to acquire Western technology for its drones and missiles, despite widespread international sanctions.In 2006, Iran illegally purchased drone engines from the German company Limbach Flugmotoren. Three years after that, Iranian engineer Yousef Abutalebi announced that his company had created an engine for a UAV.According to CAR, the company appears to have tried to conceal its role in the creation of the Shahed drones. Investigators found that the original serial numbers on the drone components found in Ukraine had been erased, apparently in an effort to conceal their origin.¬†¬†Serial number on an MD-550 engine manufactured by Mado, documented in Kyiv on November 2, 2022""These modifications have prevented investigators from identifying procurement networks that facilitate the international supply of key components to Iran,"" CAR's report says.Cables in the engine, documented in Kyiv on 20 January 2023Other Western components purchased and copied by Iran include parts of Czech-made missiles. A 2020 report by UN experts stated that the engine of Iranian Quds-1 missiles used in attacks on Saudi oil refineries last year was an ""unlicensed copy of the TJ-100 jet engine manufactured by PBS Velk√° B√≠te≈°"" in the Czech Republic.The company said it had never supplied the engine to Iran or Yemen. At the same time, the newspaper emphasises that Iran has become ""an expert in evading control"" over technology, in some cases using shell companies. A UN panel of experts found that parts exported by a Czech manufacturer to a company in Hong Kong in 2010 ended up in Iranian missiles used in 2019.CAR's Taimur Khan says that Iran ""has acquired Western components and technology for its UAV program by taking advantage of the lack of transparency in the supply chain,"" making component identification a critical method in improving export controls and sanctions mechanisms.CNN writes that the proceeds from the sale of hundreds of Shahed-136 drones to Russia will likely be reinvested in further improving the industry.Khan believes that ""given the fact that Russia has been capturing advanced Western weapons on the battlefield ‚Äì such as the Javelin anti-tank missile ‚Äì and that military cooperation is growing between the two countries, with Iran having proven 'achievements' in this regard, it is likely that they will work together to copy these types of systems.""Quote from CNN: ""There is also the possibility that Russia will use its cooperation with Iran to develop its own military drone capabilities.But until that happens, the Russian military is likely to remain a willing buyer of hundreds of other drones from Iran, a country that has turned sanctions evasion into a fine art in building its own weapons industry.""Journalists fight on their own frontline.

It carried 1,000 containers with 2,000 artillery shells, a previously unreported shipment.Sky News previously reported some other shipments from Iran to Russia.Publicly available shipping data suggests that the Rasul Gamzatov left the Iranian port of Bandar Amirabad on 8 March and arrived in Astrakhan in Russia 6 days later. The vessel sailed back to Iran in late March and left for Russia once again, staying in docks for only a day.We have launched English Twitter! Follow us! The vessel belongs to the Russian company MG-Flot, formerly TransMorFlot LLC. Last year, the US Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the company, stating that 16 of its vessels, including the Rasul Gamzatov, were transporting weapons for Russia.The company did not respond to requests for comment. The Iranian delegation to the UN and the Russian Defence Ministry also did not respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment on the issue.US officials state that Iran mainly uses cargo planes to deliver weapons to Russia, making intervention almost impossible. And taking action in the Caspian Sea would require help from the former Soviet republics located on its coast.Earlier this month, Vice Admiral Brad Cooper made an unannounced visit to Turkmenistan to discuss a range of issues, including ways to deepen cooperation and expand maritime security. He declined to comment on whether the discussion was about intercepting arms shipments in the Caspian Sea.Russia turned to Iran for help last summer. Iran initially provided Russia with hundreds of kamikaze drones and agreed to provide Russia with more than 300,000 artillery shells. One contract from September 2022, viewed by WSJ, showed a deal between Iran‚Äôs Defense Ministry and Russia‚Äôs JSC Rosoboronexport [state intermediary agency for Russia's exports/imports of defence-related and dual-use products, technologies and services] for over 74,000 artillery shells to be sold to Russia for US $1.7 million.Several months ago, the United States and other allies of Ukraine stressed that Iran was ready to send ballisticmissiles to Russia. However, according to US and foreign experts, this has not happened yet.Middle Eastern officials say Russia has not yet sent Iran advanced Su-35 fighterjets. However, a group of Iranians recently visited a factory in Russia‚Äôs east that produces these modern jet fighters. This could be a sign that the deal is moving forward.Anna Borshchevskaya, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said Iran‚Äôs relationship with Russia is gradually moving from transactional to strategic.

Yesterday and today, the enemy attacked our positions with their artillery systems almost 500 times.As for assault actions, the enemy heavily attacked the positions of our troops on the Marinka front 22 times. They did not give up hope of capturing Marinka in order to cut off and block Avdiivka.As for the tactics used by the enemy, they have changed something since yesterday.

One of the possible reasons, according to the representative of the Defence Forces: the transition from the winter period to the summer period and maintenance of equipment.

He explains that the partners of Ukraine delay the supply due to their practicality and good judgement.Source: Reznikov in an interview for the national joint 24/7 newscast on 1 MayQuote: ""I have come through the evolution from saying ‚Äòno, Oleksii, it is impossible‚Äô to the implementation of real projects several times. The first time I heard a ‚Äòno‚Äô concerning the Stinger MANPADS was in November 2021, when I had just taken office with no experience but was facing big challenges and tasks from President Zelenskyy. But now I know for sure: ‚Äòwhat is impossible today will be possible tomorrow‚Äô. We were supplied with Stingers in two months, in January 2022, from our Lithuanian partners by agreement of the partners.""Details: Reznikov added that the situation was the same with 155 mm artillery (in March the partners said that it was impossible, in May Ukraine received the first batch of 155 mm artillery systems), the Himars MLRS, the Iris-T infrared homing missile, the NASAMS system, and moreover the Patriot anti-aircraft systems ‚Äì especially the latter seemed fantastic, but as of now two divisions have taken up combat duty in Ukraine.Quote: ""So fighterjets of the modern 4+ generation will certainly be supplied.Why is this supply delayed? The delay disappoints us (because it causes deaths and injuries to the Ukrainian troops, and they are our primary value, unlike the Russian soldiers for the Russians), and we explain it to our partners. Modern aircraft platforms are an important component of the air defence system. But the partners (I am not justifying them; I am just explaining) are very practical in their decision-making. This practicality makes sense: they decide what to supply us with next responsibly.What does it mean? For instance, they made a decision to supply us with the M777 155 mm howitzers, and now they help us maintain it (they supply us with spare tubes, wheels and parts) so that we can continue using them.We have launched English Twitter! Follow us! If they decide to supply us with fighterjets, they have a number of aspects to consider first: whether they should order the new ones, which requires time, or supply us with the ones they already have, then it will take time to prepare them, train our troops, further maintain these jets and supply them with weaponry, i.e. missiles and bombs. It is all very expensive.Even the Patriot system costs US$1billion plus the missiles, and a single fighterjet costs nearly US$120 million, and further maintenance is required. Ten fighterjets equal US$1.2 billion.So when they count their budget capacities, they realise that this decision must be approved by Congress and tax payers and must not affect the current level of military aid.They consciously and responsibly want to get to the finish line of this marathon, to the victory of Ukraine.""Journalists fight on their own frontline.

The state attempted to do so in 2016 after ignoring a 2015 arrest warrant for Sudan's former president, Omar al-Bashir.In March, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, finding him guilty of the illegal deportation of thousands of children from Ukraine.

A strike that avoided detection and destruction by such air defence assets and succeeded in hitting as high-profile of a target as the Kremlin Senate Palace would be a significant embarrassment for Russia.The Kremlin‚Äôs immediate, coherent, and coordinated response to the incident suggests that the attack was internally prepared in such a way that its intended political effects outweigh its embarrassment. The Kremlin immediately accused Ukraine of conducting a terror attack, and Russian official responses coalesced rapidly around this accusation.""More details: The ISW believes that had the drone attack had not been internally staged, Russia‚Äôs official reaction would probably have been much more disorganised at first, as Russian officials tried to create a consistent message and counterbalance the impact of what was clearly an embarrassment from an informational point of view.We have launched English Twitter! Follow us! ""The Kremlin has notably failed to generate a timely and coherent information response to other military humiliations not of its own making, including the falls of Balakliya and Kherson City in September and November 2022,"" the Institute states.""The rapid and coherent presentation of an official Russian narrative around the strike suggests that Russia staged this incident in close proximity to the 9th May Victory Day holiday in order to frame the war as existential to its domestic audience. The Kremlin may use the strike to justify either cancelling or further limiting 9th May celebrations, actions that would likely augment the information effort framing the war in Ukraine as directly threatening Russian observance of revered historical events,"" the ISW report says.Background:¬†The Kremlin‚Äôs press service has claimed that Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles ""attempted to launch an attack"" on ""the Kremlin residence of Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia.""

However, journalists were able to more accurately determine their movement thanks to information from radio communications that the ships exchanged with their military bases and satellite images analysed with KSAT.In June 2022, Russian vessels capable of conducting underwater operations visited gas pipelines at least twice, and the most recent case occurred less than a week before the explosions. In one case, the ship remained in the pipeline area for almost a day.The first ship recorded near the Nord Stream on the morning of 7 June left its naval base in Kaliningrad and arrived in the area located southeast of Karlskrona and east of Bornholm. The ship spent several hours precisely in the place where branches of the Nord Stream pass at a depth of 80 metres. The name of this vessel is not mentioned. Based on information from the Danish authorities, three of the four explosions on the gas pipelines subsequently occurred here.¬†The second vessel ‚Äì the 86-metre Sibiryakov ‚Äì arrived in the area on 14 June. The ship was very close to or almost above the pipelines, sometimes moving at a low speed. Satellite images suggest that the boat was a couple hundred metres from the site of one of the explosions. In addition, the photos show another ship, which also moved with its identification device turned off, but it was impossible to identify it accurately.Images show that these two ships were located several hundred metres to several kilometres from the sites of one of the future explosions.We have launched English Twitter! Follow us! At that time, NATO BALTOPS 22 exercises were also being held in the Baltic Sea. However, after reviewing the available movement data, journalists found no units close enough to this area to see the Sibiryakov and the other ghost ship.The third recorded vessel that visited the pipelines on 21 September is¬† SB-123, a 49-metre tugboat from the Baltic Fleet. The German portal T-Online has mentioned this tug as being potentially involved in the incidents.¬†SB-123 turned off its identification device halfway from the Kaliningrad base to the Nord Stream area. Based on information from intercepted radio communications, journalists assume that the tug was in that area from approximately 20:00 on 21 September to 14:00 on 22 September.Swedish prosecutor Mats Linkvist, who is overseeing the investigation into the gas pipeline sabotage, says the study has detailed data on the movement of ships in the area, even regarding ghost ships, but cannot comment at this stage.Recently, Danish media received information from military sources that there was also a Russian SS-750 near Nord Stream four days before the explosions.¬†The journalists contacted the Russian Embassy in Copenhagen with the data they had obtained, but they declined to comment.¬†Materials appeared in March in the Western media which suggested that non-governmental groups could have been behind the explosion of gas pipelines, which might have included Russians and Ukrainians.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine was not involved in the explosions, and he suggested analysing which players might benefit from such information emerging.Journalists from the Nordic countries‚Äô broadcasters involved recently published another investigation ‚Äì that Russian military vessels and civilian ghost ships in the Baltic and North Seas are collecting data for sabotage against wind farms, gas pipelines and communication cables.Journalists fight on their own frontline.
