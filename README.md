# NAV_Capstone

### Proposed TODOs:

#### 1. Learn how to _actually_ use github. No more "Add files via upload" :) Either: 
* Learn how to use GitHub Desktop - great GUI interface
* Learn how to use git from command line

#### 2. Improve GitHub
* Determine what files are needed in GitHub
  * Remove unneeded files
* Create listing of files with descriptions
* Create diagram of how app functions and code works together
* Create technical instructions for future groups 

#### 3. Improve existing code
* Annotate code:
  * Add official doc strings to modules, classes, and functions
  * Add in line comments to other parts of code
* Make code more robust to failures with try/except logic
* Reduce code repetition by creating functions and external files for key words, etc.
* Add logging and messages so you know what is happening in the code while it is running

#### 4. Add Twitter API branch
* Sign up for Twitter API
* Add branch for Twitter in Shiny UI and `app.py`

#### 5. Improve Usability
* Improve non-technical user documentation and instructions
* Test until the program runs or fails gracefully in all reasonable scenarios
